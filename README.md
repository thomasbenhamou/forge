A forge is where raw material meets intention. You bring the codebase — these skills shape the workflow from issue to implementation to review.

---

## Skills

Forge skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard and work with any compatible agent.

| Skill | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Setup Project | `/forge-setup-project` | Create CLAUDE.md, docs/, README, and other meta-structure |
| Create Issue | `/forge-create-issue` | Collaboratively plan and create GitHub issues |
| Implement Issue | `/forge-implement-issue <number>` | Implement a feature or fix from a GitHub issue |
| Reflect on PR | `/forge-reflect-pr` | Self-review before requesting peer review |
| Address PR Feedback | `/forge-address-pr-feedback` | Address unresolved PR review comments |
| Update Changelog | `/forge-update-changelog` | Update CHANGELOG.md with user-facing changes |

## Workflow

The skills form a pipeline — each step feeds into the next:

```
forge-setup-project → forge-create-issue → forge-implement-issue → forge-reflect-pr → forge-address-pr-feedback → forge-update-changelog
```

## Install

Forge skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard and work with any compatible agent.

**Via [npx skills](https://skills.sh)** — auto-detects your agents and installs to all of them:

```bash
npx skills add mgratzer/forge
```

**Manual** — symlink into your agent's skills directory:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/forge/skills/forge-* <your-agent-skills-dir>/
```

Check your agent's docs for the skills directory path (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`).

## Documentation
